          My Clever Kitchen was founded in 2018 by Cornelia Johansson, Lovisa
          Linder Lodén and Zhiyin Li as a response to what they felt other
          recipe websites were lacking - the option to decide multiple
          ingredients yourself. To look up recipes is common, for some an
          everyday thing. But it can be a hassle finding a recipe you like just
          to realize you’re missing half the things that you need when you’re
          standing in your kitchen ready to get going. My Clever Kitchen instead
          asks the question “what do you already have at home?” and gives
          suggestions that fit whatever the answer to that may be. In addition
          to that, Clever Kitchen offers a set of additional filtering options
          to make your search as personalized as possible, giving the option
          sort on holidays, allergies, dietary restrictions, type of meal etc.
          And with a library of 5000 recipes, you can be sure to find something
          you like.
